# Recommender system

My objective for this repo was to create an artist's recommender system using the last FM dataset. The structure of the repo is as follows.

1. Data
    * Original Last FM data
    * /processed_data
    * Noval datasets scraped from the Last FM website
2. 01_initial_data_analysis
    * This is where I first analyse the data, I decide what to keep and what aspects to remove.
3. 02_further_data_analysis
4. The recommender system
    * Two models:
        1. Content-based: using artists' tags and word embeddings to compare.
        2. Collaborative filtering: Using artists and ratings.
